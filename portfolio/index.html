                <p>“Reflecting on my first project of the semester, I’m genuinely pleased with the outcome and the entire creative journey. Rebranding a company from start to finish was an exciting process, especially diving into the design aspects. This project allowed me to significantly improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator, particularly in logo creation, where I started with only a basic understanding of the software. Additionally, creating a brand guide for the first time has boosted my confidence, and I now feel much more prepared to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this experience, I also gained a deeper appreciation for client communication and the importance of gathering feedback before finalizing design decisions. Understanding the value of user research was another crucial takeaway, helping me make design choices that resonate with the intended audience. Overall, this project was not only an enjoyable learning experience but also a pivotal step forward in my development as a designer.”</p>

This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style."</p>

                <p>My teammate and I worked together on the Media Campaign and so we had a clear idea as to what we wanted to do for the development project. We both wanted to create something that would be useful to the client and help them combat their challenge which was reaching more audiences. So, we decided to create an app for them to create videos with the mascots which we thought of in the previous project for their social media platforms. With both of us having limited skills in JavaScript, we knew that creating this interactive app would be a challenge but we were determined to take on the challenge</p>

                <p>I started by creating a basic prototype to serve as a proof of concept for our idea. I did this by creating a canvas with two shapes that could move around with the arrow keys. I created two separate elements, a blue square to represent the sprite with an closed mouth and a red circle to represent the mouth open. Then Yurick added the recording function and we went to Stan and Maikel for feedback.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>My teammate and I utilized Git throughout our project to ensure seamless collaboration and version control. We began by creating a shared repository on GitLab. This allowed both of us to have access to the project's codebase. After setting up the repository, we cloned it locally using Git, enabling us to work on the code independently while keeping everything synchronized.</p>
                <p>We made sure that each commit message was descriptive and followed a clear format, like
                add sprite toggling functionality or resolve merge issue. This made it easy to review the history of changes and understand what each update was about. Occasionally, we encountered merge conflicts when both of us edited the same part of the code but with the help of research and ChatGPT, we were always able to solve the issues. Using Git's version history, we could always revert to an earlier state of the project if something broke. This gave us confidence to experiment without the fear of losing stable code.</p>
                <p>This was one of my first time collaborating with someone using git and so there were places where I want to improve on. For example, we worked on the same branch for everything but after research I learned that this is not good practice and that in the future, we should have separate branches for specific features or tasks.</p>

                <p>Over the course of the semester, I made sure to attend all of my development lectures to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We covered a lot of new and different concepts in these lectures, and I also worked on optional assignments to practice what we learned. I showed these assignments to Maikel to get feedback, which really helped me improve and understand things better and ensure I was on the right track.</p>

                    In order to take a step in the direction of becoming a media designer, I set up my LinkedIn profile and started to connect with fellow students and people in the industry. I made sure to add in my skills and their levels, as well as my location and interests. I also made myself “Open to Work” part time as a goal I have for the next year is to start doing some real work in this field. I also made sure to follow companies which I am interested in for protentional internships or job opportunities.
