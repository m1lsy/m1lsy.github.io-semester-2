                <p>Reflecting on my first project of the semester, I’m genuinely pleased with the outcome and the entire creative journey. Rebranding a company from start to finish was an exciting process, especially diving into the design aspects. This project allowed me to significantly improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator, particularly in logo creation, where I started with only a basic understanding of the software. Additionally, creating a brand guide for the first time has boosted my confidence, and I now feel much more prepared to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this experience, I also gained a deeper appreciation for client communication and the importance of gathering feedback before finalizing design decisions. Understanding the value of user research was another crucial takeaway, helping me make design choices that resonate with the intended audience. Overall, this project was not only an enjoyable learning experience but also a pivotal step forward in my development as a designer.</p>

                <p>To kick off the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM's music—a unique, improvised experimental electronic band—while creating mood boards. This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style.</p>

                <p>I found this project both exciting and challenging due to the unique nature of our client. While their distinctive style gave me plenty of room for creativity—something I don’t always experience with other clients—it was difficult to settle on a single concept. Nasmak’s ‘weird yet cool’ vibe required a media campaign that felt equally unique while remaining professional. Attending their rehearsals and speaking with the band members helped me connect with their vision, but I noticed some of my group members struggled to fully grasp their style, as it may not align with everyone’s tastes.</p>
                <p>Despite the challenges, I am proud of the final outcome. I believe our campaign addressed the band’s needs while staying true to their unconventional aesthetic. Toon, Nasmak’s frontman, seemed very pleased and amused with our work, which was incredibly rewarding. Overall, I think our campaign stood out for its originality, reflecting the band’s personality and setting it apart from what the rest of the class produced.</p>

                <p>So, we decided to create an app for them to create videos with the mascots which we thought of in the previous project for their social media platforms.

                <p>Using a combination of the code from our previous prototypes, feedback from the user testing and suggestions from teachers, we created our final version of the PMRecorder. This version included a control panel which allows users to easily change the size of the sprite and even the speed at which it moves. It also provides a button to toggle between different chacters and has a background color changer. This allows the user to create the video on a green screen and then fill it with any background they desire.</p>
                <p>The control panel also has a record/stop/download button that makes the recording process easy and efficient to use. There are also insctructions to exmplain how to use the program aswell as which keys have functions. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>My teammate and I utilized Git throughout our project to ensure seamless collaboration and version control. We began by creating a shared repository on GitLab. This allowed both of us to have access to the project's codebase. After setting up the repository, we cloned it locally using Git, enabling us to work on the code independently while keeping everything synchronized.</p>
                <p>We made sure that each commit message was descriptive and followed a clear format, like
                'add sprite toggling functionality' or 'resolve merge issue'. This made it easy to review the history of changes and understand what each update was about. Occasionally, we encountered merge conflicts when both of us edited the same part of the code but with the help of research and ChatGPT, we were always able to solve the issues. Using Git's version history, we could always revert to an earlier state of the project if something broke. This gave us confidence to experiment without the fear of losing stable code.</p>
                <p>This was one of my first time collaborating with someone using git and so there were places where I want to improve on. For example, we worked on the same branch for everything but after research I learned that this is not good practice and that in the future, we should have separate branches for specific features or tasks.</p>

I also made myself “Open to Work” part time as a goal I have for the next year is to start doing some real work in this field. I also made sure to follow companies which I am interested in for protentional internships or job opportunities.

Last year was my first time attending this incredible event, and I enjoyed it so much that I planned to buy a ticket this year. To my delight, I found out that Fontys was offering tickets to some students, and I jumped at the opportunity. I was so excited that I even persuaded a few friends to join me.</p>

                <p>Dutch Design Week showcased a large variety of exhibits, and while everything was captivating, I focused on installations and products related to technology—areas closely tied to my studies. My journey began at Klokgebouw and around Strijp S, where several exhibitions immediately caught my attention.</p>
                <p>Some of the highlights for me included a face-tracking project that mirrored users' emotions and several mechatronics projects featuring moving parts like robotic hands and heads as part of art installations. One exhibit in particular (pictured on the left) reminded me of "Can’t Help Myself" by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu—a famous artwork I studied in high school. This piece explores a machine's inability to deviate from its programmed task, and it was fascinating to see a similar concept come to life in a different medium. You can read more about the original artwork <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812">
                    <span class="highlight">here</span>
                </a>.</p>
                <p>I was also intrigued by the many innovative projects utilizing 3D printing, especially those made with biodegradable filaments and natural materials. While not directly tied to Media Design, this topic resonated with me because I’ve previously worked on projects, speeches, and essays about biofabrication. Seeing these concepts brought to life was exciting, and I enjoyed engaging with the designers to discuss their techniques and ideas.</p>
                <p>Another exhibit that stood out featured a design concept for an app aimed at providing guidance, comfort, and relaxation for individuals experiencing anxiety in crowded public spaces (agoraphobia). Described as an “invisible friend,” the app offers motivation to leave safe spaces and venture out to overcome anxiety. Although I don’t personally face these challenges, I found the concept incredibly thoughtful and innovative. The app’s design was visually appealing, with charming little characters that added a comforting touch.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>During a family holiday in Germany, I was inspired to pursue a branding project for a wine bar. We stayed in a picturesque town along the Moselle River, where we did a wine-focused cycling tour, visiting surrounding villages, tasting wines, and learning about the rich vineyard culture. What stood out to me most were the wine bottle labels—each one unique and deeply connected to its region's history and stories. For instance, one town featured an old legend about a black cat, which influenced the design of all their wine labels.</p>

                <p>As both a design student and someone passionate about wine, I found this experience to be the perfect inspiration to explore how I would craft my own unique branding for a wine bar and so I decided this would be a fun and intresting project for me.</p>
