                <p>“Reflecting on my first project of the semester, I’m genuinely pleased with the outcome and the entire creative journey. Rebranding a company from start to finish was an exciting process, especially diving into the design aspects. This project allowed me to significantly improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator, particularly in logo creation, where I started with only a basic understanding of the software. Additionally, creating a brand guide for the first time has boosted my confidence, and I now feel much more prepared to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this experience, I also gained a deeper appreciation for client communication and the importance of gathering feedback before finalizing design decisions. Understanding the value of user research was another crucial takeaway, helping me make design choices that resonate with the intended audience. Overall, this project was not only an enjoyable learning experience but also a pivotal step forward in my development as a designer.”</p>

                <p>"To kick off the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM's music—a unique, improvised experimental electronic band—while creating mood boards. This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style."</p>
