                <p>“Reflecting on my first project of the semester, I’m genuinely pleased with the outcome and the entire creative journey. Rebranding a company from start to finish was an exciting process, especially diving into the design aspects. This project allowed me to significantly improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator, particularly in logo creation, where I started with only a basic understanding of the software. Additionally, creating a brand guide for the first time has boosted my confidence, and I now feel much more prepared to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
                <p>Through this experience, I also gained a deeper appreciation for client communication and the importance of gathering feedback before finalizing design decisions. Understanding the value of user research was another crucial takeaway, helping me make design choices that resonate with the intended audience. Overall, this project was not only an enjoyable learning experience but also a pivotal step forward in my development as a designer.”</p>
