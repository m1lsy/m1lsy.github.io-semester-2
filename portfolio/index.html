                <p>Reflecting on my first project of the semester, I’m genuinely pleased with the outcome and the entire creative journey. Rebranding a company from start to finish was an exciting process, especially diving into the design aspects. This project allowed me to significantly improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator, particularly in logo creation, where I started with only a basic understanding of the software. Additionally, creating a brand guide for the first time has boosted my confidence, and I now feel much more prepared to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this experience, I also gained a deeper appreciation for client communication and the importance of gathering feedback before finalizing design decisions. Understanding the value of user research was another crucial takeaway, helping me make design choices that resonate with the intended audience. Overall, this project was not only an enjoyable learning experience but also a pivotal step forward in my development as a designer.</p>

                <p>To kick off the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM's music—a unique, improvised experimental electronic band—while creating mood boards. This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style.</p>

                <p>I found this project both exciting and challenging due to the unique nature of our client. While their distinctive style gave me plenty of room for creativity—something I don’t always experience with other clients—it was difficult to settle on a single concept. Nasmak’s ‘weird yet cool’ vibe required a media campaign that felt equally unique while remaining professional. Attending their rehearsals and speaking with the band members helped me connect with their vision, but I noticed some of my group members struggled to fully grasp their style, as it may not align with everyone’s tastes.</p>
                <p>Despite the challenges, I am proud of the final outcome. I believe our campaign addressed the band’s needs while staying true to their unconventional aesthetic. Toon, Nasmak’s frontman, seemed very pleased and amused with our work, which was incredibly rewarding. Overall, I think our campaign stood out for its originality, reflecting the band’s personality and setting it apart from what the rest of the class produced.</p>

                <p>So, we decided to create an app for them to create videos with the mascots which we thought of in the previous project for their social media platforms.

                <p>Using a combination of the code from our previous prototypes, feedback from the user testing and suggestions from teachers, we created our final version of the PMRecorder. This version included a control panel which allows users to easily change the size of the sprite and even the speed at which it moves. It also provides a button to toggle between different chacters and has a background color changer. This allows the user to create the video on a green screen and then fill it with any background they desire.</p>
                <p>The control panel also has a record/stop/download button that makes the recording process easy and efficient to use. There are also insctructions to exmplain how to use the program aswell as which keys have functions. </p>

                <p>My teammate and I utilized Git throughout our project to ensure seamless collaboration and version control. We began by creating a shared repository on GitLab. This allowed both of us to have access to the project's codebase. After setting up the repository, we cloned it locally using Git, enabling us to work on the code independently while keeping everything synchronized.</p>
                <p>We made sure that each commit message was descriptive and followed a clear format, like
                'add sprite toggling functionality' or 'resolve merge issue'. This made it easy to review the history of changes and understand what each update was about. Occasionally, we encountered merge conflicts when both of us edited the same part of the code but with the help of research and ChatGPT, we were always able to solve the issues. Using Git's version history, we could always revert to an earlier state of the project if something broke. This gave us confidence to experiment without the fear of losing stable code.</p>
                <p>This was one of my first time collaborating with someone using git and so there were places where I want to improve on. For example, we worked on the same branch for everything but after research I learned that this is not good practice and that in the future, we should have separate branches for specific features or tasks.</p>

I really enjoyed challenging myself and figuring out how to do each step. I am very happy with my process and how I created prototypes in order to understand each concept. </p>
                <p>In the end, I feel that this project stood out amongst the other projects in the class as it was completely different and unique. Due to this, the client was very enthusiast about our app as it was something the band could use immediately as a tool. The teachers were also very impressed and even invited my partner and I to showcase this project at the open day in 2025. This was very reassuring and rewarding for us, as it was a risky project that paid off in the end. </p>

                <p>I began my creating a detailed project plan with research questions and a timeline in order to remain organized throughout the creating process. Next I began to research by exploring the Instagram page and website of Glou Glou wine bar. The Instagram page, in particular, provided valuable insights through photos of their customers, drinks, food, and interiors, allowing me to understand the atmosphere they aim to create. This research serves as a foundation for ensuring my designs align with their vision and reflect their unique vibe. I then used this research to define the brands core values to help me with designing later on.</p>

I got to practice my Illustrator skills aswell as my colour theory too and I am pleased with the overall aesthetic of what I created aswell as the research I conducted.</p>
                <p>The only part of this rpoject that proved to be challanging was the timeline, as the middle of this project fell over the christmas break and so I was unable to receive feedback from my teachers during this period. However, I think I managed this problem well by seeking feedback from my father and other users which benefited me. I am really looking forward to doing more branding challanges in the future!</p>

                <p>Throughout this semester, I have developed a deeper understanding of my core values, which center around creativity, adaptability, and integrity. As I progressed through various projects, I realized how essential it is for me to create designs that not only serve a functional purpose but also evoke a meaningful experience for users. I value adaptability because, in a fast-paced field like Media Design, being open to change and embracing new technologies or methods is key to staying relevant. Integrity, for me, means maintaining high ethical standards and delivering work that is authentic and honest, whether in representing a client’s vision or my personal brand. This growth has shaped the professional I aspire to be—one who communicates transparently, remains flexible in the face of challenges, and creates designs that are both innovative and thoughtful. These values have guided my decision-making throughout the semester and will continue to influence my approach to future professional endeavors.</p>

Last year was my first time attending this incredible event, and I enjoyed it so much that I planned to buy a ticket this year.

                <p>Dutch Design Week showcased a large variety of exhibits, and while everything was captivating, I focused on installations and products related to technology—areas closely tied to my studies. My journey began at Klokgebouw and around Strijp S, where several exhibitions immediately caught my attention.</p>
                <p>Some of the highlights for me included a face-tracking project that mirrored users' emotions and several mechatronics projects featuring moving parts like robotic hands and heads as part of art installations. One exhibit in particular (pictured on the left) reminded me of "Can’t Help Myself" by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu—a famous artwork I studied in high school. This piece explores a machine's inability to deviate from its programmed task, and it was fascinating to see a similar concept come to life in a different medium. You can read more about the original artwork <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812">
                    <span class="highlight">here</span>
                </a>.</p>
                <p>I was also intrigued by the many innovative projects utilizing 3D printing, especially those made with biodegradable filaments and natural materials. While not directly tied to Media Design, this topic resonated with me because I’ve previously worked on projects, speeches, and essays about biofabrication. Seeing these concepts brought to life was exciting, and I enjoyed engaging with the designers to discuss their techniques and ideas.</p>
                <p>Another exhibit that stood out featured a design concept for an app aimed at providing guidance, comfort, and relaxation for individuals experiencing anxiety in crowded public spaces (agoraphobia). Described as an “invisible friend,” the app offers motivation to leave safe spaces and venture out to overcome anxiety. Although I don’t personally face these challenges, I found the concept incredibly thoughtful and innovative. The app’s design was visually appealing, with charming little characters that added a comforting touch.</p>

                <p>During a family holiday in Germany, I was inspired to pursue a branding project for a wine bar. We stayed in a picturesque town along the Moselle River, where we did a wine-focused cycling tour, visiting surrounding villages, tasting wines, and learning about the rich vineyard culture. What stood out to me most were the wine bottle labels—each one unique and deeply connected to its region's history and stories. For instance, one town featured an old legend about a black cat, which influenced the design of all their wine labels.</p>

                <p>As both a design student and someone passionate about wine, I found this experience to be the perfect inspiration to explore how I would craft my own unique branding for a wine bar and so I decided this would be a fun and intresting project for me.</p>

                <p>As I am repeating this semester, I have been doing a lot of thinking over the past few months as to where I see myself taking this degree and what I want to do. After failing Semester 2, I initially felt quite angry and upset as this was quite unexpected but after meeting with my assessors and talking about it, I changed my mindset and started to think of it as an opportunity to expand my knowledge rather than a set back in my school career. In fact, looking back I am thankful that I repeated semester 2 as although I feel I would have managed in semester 3, I have learnt so much and feel more confident with my work now. I was very enthusiastic about each project that I worked on this semester and I personally feel this is evident in my work. </p>
                <p>I feel that my coding abilities have also improved drastically and some errors that I was making last semester are now evident to me and I was able to work on them and correct them aswell as feel more confident in my HTML,CSS and JavaScript. As I started at Fontys with no coding experience, it has been quite difficult to learn all of these new concepts and so last semester I felt overwhelmed sometimes and did not even attempt to do coding challenges given to us in class. Through learning these concepts again, I felt more confident to attempt these challenges now and I often surprised myself and succeeded. </p>

                <p>In regards to what job I see myself perusing, I am still undecided but I do have a few ideas. I am a very creative person and I really enjoy the design aspects of this course and it was a large factor that influenced why I selected Media Design as my profile choice. I have really enjoyed branding challenges as I feel these projects allow me to really be creative with logos, typography and colours. I also really enjoyed designing my portfolio and researching other interesting websites with unique designs for inspiration. </p>
                <p>I do however also enjoy coding and giving myself challenges as it always feels very rewarding to figure out how to create something. Thus, I would not like to just peruse a job in Web Design or Branding for example, but rather a job that combines creativity with development. So, right now I am interested in becoming a creative developer and working for a large creative agency. I hope in the next semesters I will be able to learn more and my passions and skills and hopefully my future plans will become more clear. </p>
