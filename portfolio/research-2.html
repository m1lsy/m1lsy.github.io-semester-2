            </div>
            <div class="process-text">
                <p>To begin the media campaign research process for Nasmak, I utilized a combination of online research and audience analysis. I focused on understanding the music consumption habits and behaviors of Nasmak’s target audience, specifically younger music fans aged 18-30. This involved researching popular social media platforms, music discovery trends, and concert attendance patterns, while also analyzing the band’s current audience demographics and preferences. The insights gathered helped shape the campaign’s direction and content strategy.

                <h4>Effective Platforms for Reaching Younger Music Fans:</h4>
                <p>
                    TikTok is the most effective platform for reaching Gen Z and younger Millennials, with its viral content, trending music challenges, and ease of discovery. Music snippets, short live clips, and fan-generated content are particularly engaging.</p><br>
                <p>
                    Instagram remains popular among both Millennials and Gen Z, combining visual and video content. Reels, behind-the-scenes footage, and concert updates engage fans directly. Features like Stories allow for real-time interaction through polls and Q&As.</p><br>
                <p>
                    YouTube continues to be a go-to platform for discovering music, especially for longer videos like full-length music videos, live recordings, and interviews. Collaborations with YouTubers can expand reach.</p>

                <p>
                    MULTI-FORM ENGAGEMENT: Nasmak can maximize audience engagement by producing content that works across these three platforms. Short-form videos (TikTok), Reels (Instagram), and full-length performances (YouTube) will help capture attention from a wide range of music fans.

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Recognizing that growing their fanbase was a key challenge, I began brainstorming new strategies to help Nasmak expand their audience. An idea I had was to partner with larger Instagram accounts, such as @eindhovencity, to increase visibility. After reaching out, I discovered that advertising with them was free, and they provided clear instructions for submitting events. This offered a cost-effective way to promote the band. Additionally, I recommended placing posters in the Strijp S area of Eindhoven, a lively and alternative hotspot, to further boost local visibility in places where potential fans would be.</p>

                <p>Along with two of my teammates, I attended one of Nasmak's rehearsals to experience their ‘vibe’ firsthand and gain a deeper understanding of what they’re all about, aswell as meet the other members of the band. This allowed us to connect more with their unique energy and style. During the session, we also captured photos and videos of their rehearsal, which we could later use for content creation to enhance their visual identity and promotional materials.</p>
