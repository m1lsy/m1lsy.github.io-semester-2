            <div class="process-text">
                <p>I began my research by exploring the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/glouglouamsterdam/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Instagram Page</span></a> and <a href="https://glouglou.nl/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Website</span></a> of Glou Glou wine bar. The Instagram page, in particular, provided valuable insights through photos of their customers, drinks, food, and interiors, allowing me to understand the atmosphere they aim to create. This research serves as a foundation for ensuring my designs align with their vision and reflect their unique vibe.</p>
