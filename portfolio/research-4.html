            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>I started by creating a project plan and timeline to ensure that my work on the Glou Glou branding project remains structured, focused, and manageable within the given timeframe. This step is important because it helps break down a large, complex task into smaller steps, reducing the risk of feeling overwhelmed and ensuring steady progress. A clear timeline also allows me to allocate enough time for research, concept development, feedback, and revisions, ensuring that each stage of the project receives the attention it requires. By following an organized plan, I can improve the quality of my final deliverables while staying on track to meet deadlines effectively.</p>

                <p>I began my research by exploring the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/glouglouamsterdam/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Instagram Page</span></a> and <a href="https://glouglou.nl/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Website</span></a> of Glou Glou wine bar. The Instagram page, in particular, provided valuable insights through photos of their customers, drinks, food, and interiors, allowing me to understand the atmosphere they aim to create. From this information, I began to document the aspects that my branding should reflect as well as ideas for visuals.</p>

                <h4>Playful and Inviting Atmosphere</h4>
                <p>The branding I create should reflect Glou Glou’s vibrant and relaxed social vibe, emphasizing its appeal as a community hub for wine lovers and a meeting place for people.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Natural Wine Aesthetic</h4>
                <p>I should make use of design elements like handwritten fonts, bold yet earthy colour palettes, and organic shapes to match the ‘natural wine culture’.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Trendy and Authentic Personality</h4>
                <p>I should use modern yet approachable designs that reflect the relaxed sophistication of Glou Glou, inspired by its outdoor charm, lively gatherings, and warm, rustic atmosphere.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Consistency Across Platforms</h4>
                <p>My designs should be cohesive across digital (social media, website) and physical (menus, signs) applications to align the bar’s online and offline presence and create a recognizable image for the brand.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                <p>Glou Glou appeals to wine enthusiasts who appreciate natural, artisan wines and young professionals aged 20–35 seeking trendy, casual venues. It also attracts creative and social individuals who may be drawn to its warm, inviting atmosphere, perfect for casual gatherings and creating a feeling of community. </p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Next, I decided to conduct some field research and read online articles about natural wine to better understand both the product and the community that surrounds it. I learned that natural wine is made with minimal intervention, focusing on organic processes and highlighting the grape’s natural flavors. The community values sustainability, authenticity, and the storytelling behind each bottle, which has helped natural wine gain popularity among younger, eco-conscious audiences. This insight will help me align Glou Glou’s branding with the values and aesthetics of the natural wine movement.</p>

                <p>To capture Glou Glou’s identity, I created four core values that will guide its visual and conceptual branding.</p>
                <p>'Playful' embraces a relaxed, fun atmosphere. This can be conveyed through quirky design elements like handwritten typography, lighthearted illustrations, and vibrant messaging.</p>
                <p>'Vibrant' represts the energy of its gatherings and its colorful, community vibe should be reflected in a colourful colour palette and lively, organic patterns that evoke movement and joy.</p>
                <p>'Welcoming' as a community-focused space, Glou Glou should feel approachable and warm. Soft textures, friendly imagery, and rustic elements can highlight its inviting nature.</p>
                <p>'Natural' to represent the roots in natural wine culture, emphasizing simplicity, sustainability, and authenticity. Earthy tones, organic shapes, and raw textures will reflect the bar’s connection to nature and craftsmanship.</p>
