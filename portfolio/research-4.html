            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>I started by creating a project plan and timeline to ensure that my work on the Glou Glou branding project remains structured, focused, and manageable within the given timeframe. This step is important because it helps break down a large, complex task into smaller steps, reducing the risk of feeling overwhelmed and ensuring steady progress. A clear timeline also allows me to allocate enough time for research, concept development, feedback, and revisions, ensuring that each stage of the project receives the attention it requires. By following an organized plan, I can improve the quality of my final deliverables while staying on track to meet deadlines effectively.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="process-text">
                <p>I began my research by exploring the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/glouglouamsterdam/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Instagram Page</span></a> and <a href="https://glouglou.nl/"  target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Website</span></a> of Glou Glou wine bar. The Instagram page, in particular, provided valuable insights through photos of their customers, drinks, food, and interiors, allowing me to understand the atmosphere they aim to create. From this information, I began to document the aspects that my branding should reflect as well as ideas for visuals.</p>

                <h4>Playful and Inviting Atmosphere</h4>
                <p>The branding I create should reflect Glou Glou’s vibrant and relaxed social vibe, emphasizing its appeal as a community hub for wine lovers and a meeting place for people.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Natural Wine Aesthetic</h4>
                <p>I should make use of design elements like handwritten fonts, bold yet earthy colour palettes, and organic shapes to match the ‘natural wine culture’.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Trendy and Authentic Personality</h4>
                <p>I should use modern yet approachable designs that reflect the relaxed sophistication of Glou Glou, inspired by its outdoor charm, lively gatherings, and warm, rustic atmosphere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Consistency Across Platforms</h4>
                <p>My designs should be cohesive across digital (social media, website) and physical (menus, signs) applications to align the bar’s online and offline presence and create a recognizable image for the brand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                <p>Glou Glou appeals to wine enthusiasts who appreciate natural, artisan wines and young professionals aged 20–35 seeking trendy, casual venues.

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>In addition to studying Glou Glou’s existing branding, I conducted a competitive analysis by examining how other wine bars—especially those that focus on natural or artisan wines—approach their branding. This helped me identify trends, best practices, and potential pitfalls to avoid in order to create a unique identity for Glou Glou.</p>
                <p>I focused on wine bars with a similar concept, particularly those catering to young professionals, wine enthusiasts, and eco-conscious audiences. The analysis covered their logos, color palettes, typography, marketing materials, and the overall tone of their digital and physical presence.</p>

                <h2>Residency for the People, Eindhoven</h2>

        <section class="grid-container block-information">
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                <p>Residency for the People employs a minimalist logo with clean, modern typography and a neutral color palette of mainly black and white. Their target audience includes local designers and students, which they successfully reach by branding themselves as a "meeting place for creatives." </p>
                <p>This is effectively conveyed through their uniquely designed posters on Instagram, which showcase artistic and trendy visuals that resonate with the creative community. Additionally, their marketing strategy focuses heavily on creating a sense of exclusivity and sophistication, aligning well with their desired audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                <p>While the minimalist style fosters a design-centric and high-end ambiance, it risks alienating potential customers by lacking warmth and personality. The bar appears more exclusive than welcoming, which limits its appeal to a broader audience. For Glou Glou, this is a reminder of the need to balance sophistication with an approachable, lively atmosphere to create a more inclusive and inviting brand image.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the limited color palette (mostly black and white) may feel too sterile for a wine bar that aims to evoke fun and warmth. Glou Glou can differentiate itself by using vibrant colors and playful design elements to reflect its cheerful, community-focused vibe.</p>

                <h2>Zomer Bar, Amsterdam</h2>

        <section class="grid-container block-information">
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                <p>Zomer Bar has successfully created a casual, laid-back ambiance, which is reflected in their Instagram content. Their images focus on candid, informal moments such as groups of people socializing, food being shared, and friendly staff interacting with guests. This approach helps establish a personal connection with their audience, creating a sense of community and familiarity. </p>
                <p>Additionally, Zomer Bar hosts frequent events, which they promote using colorful posters and quirky illustrations, giving their brand a youthful and fun personality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                <p>Despite having an engaging and approachable digital presence, Zomer Bar lacks a consistent visual identity, particularly when it comes to their logo and overall brand design. The absence of a strong, recognizable logo makes it harder for the bar to establish itself as a distinct brand in the minds of its customers. </p>
                <p>For Glou Glou, this underscores the importance of developing a cohesive and recognizable brand identity, including a memorable logo, consistent typography, and a well-defined color palette that can be applied across all platforms and materials. Additionally, while the informal style works well for Zomer Bar, Glou Glou’s branding should aim to strike a balance between informality and elegance, ensuring it appeals to both casual visitors and more sophisticated wine enthusiasts.</p>

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Balancing Sophistication with a Playful Tone</h4>
                <p>While Residency for the People excels in creating a sleek, minimalist aesthetic, Glou Glou should avoid becoming too exclusive or design-centric. Instead, it can blend a modern, clean look with vibrant, playful elements to convey both sophistication and warmth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Establishing a Strong Brand Identity</h4>
                <p>One of Zomer Bar’s key weaknesses is its lack of a cohesive visual identity. For Glou Glou, consistency across all platforms (social media, website, in-store materials) is essential. A clear logo, well-chosen typography, and a bold, earthy color palette will help make the brand more recognizable and memorable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Creating a Welcoming, Community-Focused Atmosphere</h4>
                <p>Both competitors emphasize community in different ways—Residency for the People through its appeal to creatives and Zomer Bar through its casual, social vibe. Glou Glou can build on these strengths by positioning itself as a friendly, approachable wine bar that offers a vibrant space for both casual gatherings and special events.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Next, I decided to conduct some field research and read online articles about natural wine to better understand both the product and the community that surrounds it. I learned that natural wine is made with minimal intervention, focusing on organic processes and highlighting the grape’s natural flavors. The community values sustainability, authenticity, and the storytelling behind each bottle, which has helped natural wine gain popularity among younger, eco-conscious audiences. This insight will help me align Glou Glou’s branding with the values and aesthetics of the natural wine movement.</p>

                <p>To capture Glou Glou’s identity, I created four core values that will guide its visual and conceptual branding.</p>
                <p>'Playful' embraces a relaxed, fun atmosphere. This can be conveyed through quirky design elements like handwritten typography, lighthearted illustrations, and vibrant messaging.</p>
                <p>'Vibrant' represts the energy of its gatherings and its colorful, community vibe should be reflected in a colourful colour palette and lively, organic patterns that evoke movement and joy.</p>
                <p>'Welcoming' as a community-focused space, Glou Glou should feel approachable and warm. Soft textures, friendly imagery, and rustic elements can highlight its inviting nature.</p>
                <p>'Natural' to represent the roots in natural wine culture, emphasizing simplicity, sustainability, and authenticity. Earthy tones, organic shapes, and raw textures will reflect the bar’s connection to nature and craftsmanship.</p>
