                <h4>Orient in the relevant tech, media, and design landscape</h4>
                <p>Over the course of the semester, I explored the latest tools, trends, and practices in the design landscape. My engagement with software like Figma, Illustrator and Photoshop aswell as research skills allowed me to stay up-to-date with current industry standards. For instance, in my portfolio creation, I researched deasign trends by looking on websites such as Dribble and Awwwards for inspiration from other creators in the field, which influenced my design decisions and ultimatley left me with a portfolio that is modern and sleek.</p>
                <p>In Project One, I conducted research using the Field method and interviews to orient myself and understand user preferences, aswell as used modern industry tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop for brand guide, logo and stylescape creation. The research I conducted in Project Two expanded my knowledge of audience demographics and media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, enabling me to design a strategic, multi-platform rebranding effort. </p>

                <h4>Interactive Media Products</h4>
                <p>The development project (Project Three) is a great example where my ability to create advanced interactive media products that serve as proof of concepts is showcased. In the first prototype, I developed a canvas with basic movable shapes controlled by keyboard inputs, offering an initial simulation of the app's intended functionality. This served as the foundation for the basic functionality of the project and a way to explain the concept to steakholders and get feedback before creating a real version. The final prototype incorporated advanced features like character toggling, size and movement adjustments, and blinking animations, providing a detailed simulation of the final product. These prototypes allowed stakeholders to explore and interact with the design, refining the concept before coding was finalized.</p>
                <p>Similarly, in my portfolio project, I utilized Figma to craft a clickable, interactive prototype, enabling users to experience the portfolio's navigation and layout as a polished proof of concept before development began. These experiences illustrate my capacity to design and develop interactive media products that balance creativity, functionality, and stakeholder engagement.</p>

                <h4>Tested with Users and Stakeholders</h4>
                <p>Testing was a crucial part of my process across all projects to ensure that the final interactive products were user-friendly and aligned with their intended purposes. Some instances include in Project Three where I asked users to look at the posters I had made and tell me what aspects they felt were lacking in order to get maximum interaction with my final iterations. I also conducted a full User Test on my final prototype for my Recorder App in Project Three where I created a list of instructions for a user (who fit into the target audience) to follow and watched how they interacted with the program. This provided insights into small problems that could be changed in the final version. </p>
                <p>Similarly I conducted another user test for my portfolio navigation, in order to see if users could easily navigate from one project to the next as my design is quite minimal. Like the previous test, I formulated a list of instructions for the user to follow and then watched their interactions. This helped me make small design tweaks to ensure my portfolio was user friendly. </p>

                <h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>Throughout the semester, I fully embraced version control as an integral part of my development process. For our group project, I utilized GitLab to collaborate effectively with my partner. This allowed us to work independently on the same project while ensuring our contributions were seamlessly integrated. This experience not only enhanced my understanding of version control workflows but also taught me the importance of clear communication and conflict resolution when merging code. </p>
                <p>Additionally, I used Git for my personal coding exercises, enabling instructors to review my work easily and provide valuable feedback. For my personal portfolio, version control proved invaluable in tracking changes, experimenting with new features, and rolling back to previous versions when needed. I also created README files for both my portfolio and group project, providing clear documentation on their purpose, setup instructions, and usage details, ensuring they were accessible to others. </p>
                <p>I committed frequently throughout all projects, maintaining a detailed history of my progress. This disciplined approach reinforced best practices, such as writing meaningful commit messages and branching effectively. Overall, version control, combined with thorough documentation, was a cornerstone of my workflow this semester, significantly boosting my productivity, collaboration skills, and project organization.</p>

                <h4>Development</h4>
                <p>During the semester, I demonstrated proficiency in front-end development languages by effectively combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in multiple projects. A standout achievement was co-developing an interactive recorder application using JavaScript and the Canvas API. This application featured a client’s logo as a customizable mascot, allowing users to animate its movements, make it "talk," change backgrounds, and export their creations as MP4 files. This project showcased my ability to develop dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly web applications.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I designed and built a personal portfolio website, utilizing CSS Grid layouts to achieve a clean, minimalistic style and emphasizing responsive design principles for seamless usability across devices.</p>
                <p>To further practice concepts learnt in class, I also took part in coding bootcamps created by Maikel and actively sought feedback to ensure I was on the right track. These bootcamps included CSS challanges where I learnt about CSS annimations and keyframes aswell as JavaScript functionalities. </p>

                <h4>Using Professional Design Tools</h4>
                <p>During the semester, I utilized industry-standard design tools from Adobe Creative Cloud, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator, and other software like Figma, to create professional-quality deliverables tailored to the intended audience. For image editing and composition, I relied on Photoshop to produce high-resolution visuals optimized for both print and web. This skill can be seen used in my stylescape for Project One aswell as my posters for Project Two. Vector graphics and scalable assets were developed using Illustrator to ensure the designs could be resized without loss of quality, which was crucial for various branding materials. This was used for my logo designs in Project One and Project Four. </p>
                <p>I also utilized Figma as a tool to design my portfolio website in an efficient way which allowed me to design my webpages to a perfect sized template of my computer screen and use grids to ensure everything was positioned perfectly aswell as create clickable, interactive prototypes. Understanding the specific requirements of each deliverable, I carefully selected appropriate file formats (e.g., exporting PNGs for web use and PDFs for documents) and resolutions to guarantee that the final assets met the highest professional standards and looked good in my portfolio website. This workflow demonstrated my ability to choose the right tools for each task and deliver outputs fit for purpose.

                <h4>Iteratively Design Visual Works</h4>
                <p>Throughout the project, I employed an iterative design process to develop various visual works across all projects. A great example of this is my logo creation in Project One where the design began with multiple initial concepts, each exploring different styles and colors. After presenting these options to both users and project stakeholders, I gathered feedback and refined the designs accordingly. This iterative approach allowed me to address usability concerns, aesthetic preferences, and technical requirements at each stage of development. This is also seen when designing the stylescape for Project One, I iterated my designs based on results from the survey on the colour palettes aswell as steakholder feedback. This same process is also seen in Project Four where I iterated my logo ideas based on feedback from professionals in the industry.</p>
                <p>Similarly, in my portfolio design you can see clear iterations based on feedback from stakeholders and users. I started my designs with simple wireframes and slowly evolved by making small tweaks based on feedback from my assessors on design elements and documentation aswell as users by conducting user tests on elements such as navigation to further iterate my portfolio into a user friendly website.</p>

                <h4>Communication with Stakeholders</h4>
                <p>Throughout these projects, I demonstrated effective communication with a range of stakeholders, including clients, external partners, and the target audience. In Project One, I engaged stakeholders early by conducting interviews with students from the target demographic to gather insights on preferences and expectations. Regular updates, such as stylescape presentations and logo iterations, were shared with the client to ensure alignment. Feedback was actively integrated, balancing user preferences—like favoring a blue color palette for its calm and professional appeal—with the client’s vision.</p>
                <p>In Project Two, I maintained open communication with the band Nasmak by providing regular progress updates and gathering their feedback to ensure that the final deliverables reflected their creative vision. I also coordinated with external stakeholders, such as @eindhovencity, to arrange promotional opportunities that expanded the band’s reach in a cost-effective manner.</p>
                <p>In both Project Three and my Portfolio creation process, I also ensured I was constanly communicating with my assessors and teachers (stakeholders). In Project Three I would actively show teachers my work and code to ensure it was aligned with their visions and to ensure I was doing it correctly. In my Portfolio Creation, I also made sure to show my work to my assessors and ask questions as they are the "target auidence" of this project and I had to ensure my work aligned with their requirments and expectations. These experiences taught me how to handle diverse feedback from academic and professional stakeholders, manage expectations, and maintain alignment with project goals.</p>

                <h4>Exploratory Research</h4>
                <p>Throughout my projects, I conducted exploratory research to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and challenges involved. In Project One, I gathered insights from the target audience through interviews to understand their preferences and thought processes when selecting a minor study. This approach aligned with the Field Research Method from the DOT framework. The information collected was critically evaluated by cross-referencing it with reliable industry sources, ensuring that my design decisions were well-grounded.</p>
                <p>In Project Two, exploratory research focused on understanding the band’s audience and demographic. This involved analyzing existing online data about the preferences of the target audience, studying promotional strategies, and identifying new opportunities, such as collaborating with local social media pages like @eindhovencity. This process exemplifies the Library Method from the DOT framework.</p>
                <p>For Project Three, I created multiple prototype iterations, which served as a form of research by allowing me to test and refine various approaches—an application of the Workshop Method. These iterations provided valuable insights on how to achieve the desired final outcome. Additionally, the usability tests I conducted during both Project Three and my portfolio development demonstrate exploratory research through the Lab Method, as they provided crucial feedback for improving functionality and user experience.

                <h4>Project organisation</h4>
                <p>During the semester, I applied fundamental project management techniques by setting clear goals, creating detailed timelines, and dividing tasks fairly among team members to ensure efficient collaboration. Initially, we outlined key milestones and assigned responsibilities based on each member’s strengths which helped streamline the workflow and allowed all group members to know what they were doing. As the project progressed, unforeseen challenges arose, such as shifting requirements, tight deadlines and absent members. To address these issues, I adapted the project plan by reprioritizing tasks, reallocating resources, and scheduling additional check-ins to maintain progress.</p>
                <p>I also utilized tools like Trello to track task completion and update the team in real time. This flexible approach ensured that we stayed on track despite setbacks, while maintaining clear communication and accountability. Through this experience, I developed a deeper understanding of how to manage projects effectively by balancing structured planning with adaptability.</p>

                <p>I proactively sought out feedback throughout my projects, ensuring I consistently improved my work. In Project One, I actively asked my client and peers for their insights on my design choices, particularly regarding the visual appeal and functionality of my work. This allowed me to refine my concepts and adjust my approach based on their input, ensuring I met both user needs and client expectations. I also took the time to reflect on the feedback I received, documenting suggestions and making necessary changes in my designs. In Project Two, I took a similar approach by actively requesting feedback from the band Nasmak PM at every stage of the project, which allowed me to tailor my work to their vision and ensure the final result was in line with their expectations. In both projects, I consistently reflected on the feedback received, evaluating its relevance and applying it to improve my performance. </p>
                <p>For my portfolio, I also actively sought feedback from my assessors to ensure my work was proving the learning outcomes. I made sure to incorporate their suggestions in order to create the best version of my work that I could. This proactive approach not only enhanced my work but also contributed to my personal growth, as I was able to identify areas for improvement and take responsibility for my development.</p>

                <h4>Identifying Core Values</h4>
                <p>In reflecting on my progress, I identified the values that shape my professional aspirations, including a focus on user-centered design, continuous learning, and collaboration. This semester, I recognized that my passion for interactive design and technology drives my career goals, and I have begun to articulate these values in my personal branding. As I continue to develop as a media designer, I aim to integrate these values into my work, ensuring that my designs are not only visually compelling but also functional and accessible to users.</p>
