                <p>For this project, I focused on testing the design with both users and stakeholders to ensure that the final product was not only visually appealing but also aligned with the program’s goals. I started by conducting interviews with students who were in the process of choosing their minor, gathering valuable insights about their preferences and the user experience. Based on their feedback, I identified areas for improvement, such as the need for more visuals on the website to better explain the minor.</p>
                <p>I also gathered input from stakeholders, including the client and industry professionals, who provided feedback on the branding and logo design. This feedback led to multiple design iterations and refinements to ensure the final product was aligned with the needs of the target audience and fulfilled its purpose.</p>

                <h4>PROJECT ONE</h4>
                <p>For this rebranding project, I utilized Adobe Creative Cloud, focusing mainly on Adobe Illustrator, to create visual elements. Illustrator served as my primary tool for the logo creation, where I was able to use its many features in order to make my ideas come to life.</p>
                <p>I have some basic knowledge of this programme but through this project I was able to build on that and learn how to do new technqiues through watching YouTube tutorials and asking ChatGPT for help when I did not know how to make something. This demonstrated my ability to select and effectively use the right tool for producing high-quality deliverables tailored to the project’s objectives.</p>

                <p>I adopted an iterative design process throughout the project, constantly refining and improving my designs based on feedback from users, stakeholders, and industry professionals. For example, after conducting user research, I adjusted the branding and website visuals to ensure they resonated more with creative-minded students. Once I developed the logo concept, I presented multiple iterations to the client, incorporating their feedback to improve the design.</p>
                <p>Additionally, after gathering survey results on color preferences, I created different versions of the stylescape and logo to explore different color palettes, ultimately selecting the most appropriate one based on user feedback. This iterative process ensured that the final product was aligned with both user needs and client expectations.</p>

I paid particular attention to the layout and aesthetic appeal of the logo, color scheme, and overall branding, ensuring the visual identity was clear, cohesive, and resonated with the target audience.</p>
                <p>I also made design choices, such as selecting shades of blues and greens, to communicate the values of innovation, collaboration, professionalism, and fun. Every visual decision was backed by thoughtful reasoning based on the research findings and client feedback, ensuring the design was both purposeful and visually effective.</p>

                <h4>Project One</h4>
                <p>To maintain organisation in our group, my team and I used Trello, an industry-standard project management tool. Trello allowed us to create task boards, assign responsibilities, set deadlines, and monitor each others progress in real-time. This ensured clear communication within the team and visibility over ongoing tasks, helping us stay on track. This helped us split tasks fairly and avoid people work on the same thing. </p>
                <p>This became helpful when some of the team members were not present in class as it allowed us to view what they were working on, in order to update each other and teachers on our progress. </p>

                <p>In this project, I developed my understanding of project organisation by collaborating with my team and using Trello for task management. We set clear goals, created timelines, and divided tasks based on each person’s strengths. I contributed to various aspects of the campaign, such as research, design, and communication, while ensuring that deadlines were met and all tasks were progressing smoothly.</p>
                <p>When unforeseen challenges arose, such as adjusting the designs based on client feedback or coordinating team schedules, I adapted our plans to keep the project on track.

                <p>Additionally, I analyzed the clarity of the Health Innovation Minor’s webpage and branding elements, identifying areas for improvement, such as incorporating more visuals to engage creative-minded users.

                <p>The iterative process of logo creation was also well-documented, showcasing the evolution of ideas and justifications for design decisions.

I organized the feedback into clear, actionable points and shared them with both the team and the client, which helped us make the necessary changes.</p>
                <p>I also made sure to present the design updates and campaign strategies in an easy-to-understand way, adjusting how I communicated depending on whether I was talking to the creative team or the band’s management. </p>

                <h4>Project One</h4>
                <p>Throughout the rebranding project, I actively sought feedback from clients, peers, instructors, and users, demonstrating initiative. By presenting multiple iterations of the logo and stylescape, I gained valuable insights, such as the preference for certain color palette that aligned with the core values and brand identity. I also engaged with the target audience through interviews and surveys to better understand their needs and preferences, refining the design to align with their expectations.</p>
                <p>Client feedback on the initial logo inspired me to create a more innovative design, incorporating a lightbulb with a cross-shaped filament to symbolize creativity and healthcare. By analyzing and applying this feedback from others, I improved the final deliverables while growing as a designer committed to collaboration and iterative development.</p>

                <h4>Project Two</h4>
                <p>I actively sought feedback throughout the process, sharing my posters with the client and conducting user testing to gather input from a diverse group of people. This allowed me to improve my work by considering different perspectives. When the client requested more digital posters for social media, I created optimized versions for Instagram.</p>
                <p>I also documented feedback in the User Testing Insights section, analyzing what people liked and suggested for improvement, such as the fisheye effect and clarity of event details. Reflecting on this feedback, I made thoughtful adjustments, like incorporating brighter colors and adding social media handles, to enhance the final designs.</p>

                <p>Throughout the design process, I focused on creativity, innovation, and aligning my work with Nasmak PM’s identity. Inspired by their experimental sound, I created mood boards, used fisheye effects, and designed posters that reflected their avant-garde style. This helped me realize my core values of creativity and authenticity in my work. As the semester progressed, I adapted to the band's needs, shifting from audience engagement on platforms like TikTok and Instagram to refining designs for their digital presence.</p>
                <p>Working with my team, using Trello for task management, and gathering feedback helped me grow in leadership and collaboration. Reflecting on feedback and making adjustments shows my commitment to continuous improvement and to becoming a creative professional who is responsive, innovative, and delivers quality work.</p>
