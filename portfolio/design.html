            <div class="process-text">
                <p>After completing my research and establishing a clear direction, I moved into the design phase. I began by developing a stylescape to set the visual tone and guide the aesthetic approach, which then led into creating the logo. Throughout this process, I gathered feedback not only from the client but also from industry professionals and instructors, ensuring the design was refined and aligned with both the client’s vision and professional standards.

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>I began the logo creation process by iterating on the client’s existing logo, incorporating a cross shape and circuit elements. However, I realised this design was too similar to the original and lacked originality. I then came up with the concept of representing innovation through a lightbulb, with the cross symbolising healthcare as the filament inside. After tracing a reference image of a lightbulb in Illustrator, I incorporated the cross shape as the filament. This concept was presented to the client, who provided positive feedback. I further refined the design by experimenting with gaps in the filament lines and variations in the lightbulb base. After gathering feedback from Josh and my peers, I finalised the logo.</p>

                <p>Once the logo, color palette, and style direction were confirmed, I collaborated with another group member to create the Brand Guide. We outlined essential brand elements like typography, logo usage, color variations, and visual themes, ensuring consistency and clarity across applications. This process improved my understanding of brand cohesion and gave me valuable teamwork experience in crafting a professional, cohesive guide.</p>
