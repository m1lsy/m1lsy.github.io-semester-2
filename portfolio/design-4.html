            <p>To begin the design aspect of the project, I created a mood board containing inspirational images that I found on platforms such as Dribble and Pinterest, to clearly convey the ‘vibe’ I envisioned and set the creative direction. I also shared this mood board with Josh, whom I chose to guide me through the process, so that he could also get an understanding of what I was trying to create. </p>

            <p>Once I identified the brand’s core values, I began exploring what kind of color palette would best embody them. To me, these values evoke a colorful, organic aesthetic with a touch of green to reflect nature. I also wanted the palette to feel warm and inviting, creating a sense of comfort and approachability. So, I began to experiment with colours that I felt worked best together in order to create some variations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>I then began to look for font ideas that I could use for the logo. I felt that a bold, text-based logo with unique typography would best capture the vision I had in mind. Additionally, I planned to incorporate graphics that could be used as patterns or visual elements to enhance the overall aesthetic. Since this wine bar isn’t an actual client of mine, I didn’t have access to client input or feedback. However, I see this as a positive opportunity—it gives me complete creative freedom to shape this project and fully express my personal style as a designer.</p>
