            <p>To begin the design aspect of the project, I created a mood board containing inspirational images that I found on platforms such as Dribble and Pinterest, to clearly convey the ‘vibe’ I envisioned and set the creative direction. I also shared this mood board with Josh, whom I chose to guide me through the process, so that he could also get an understanding of what I was trying to create. </p>

        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>Once I identified the brand’s core values, I began exploring what kind of color palette would best embody them. To me, these values evoke a colorful, organic aesthetic with a touch of green to reflect nature. I also wanted the palette to feel warm and inviting, creating a sense of comfort and approachability. So, I began to experiment with colours that I felt worked best together in order to create some variations.</p>

        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>I then began to look for font ideas that I could use for the logo. I felt that a bold, text-based logo with unique typography would best capture the vision I had in mind. Additionally, I planned to incorporate graphics that could be used as patterns or visual elements to enhance the overall aesthetic. Since this wine bar isn’t an actual client of mine, I didn’t have access to client input or feedback. However, I see this as a positive opportunity—it gives me complete creative freedom to shape this project and fully express my personal style as a designer.</p>

            <p>After creating 8 options for the start of my wordmark design, I decided that I wanted some feedback on the designs that I had created. As it was the Christmas holiday period, I was unable to receive feedback from my coaches and so I showed them to my father who is considered as a professional in the industry as he has his own company that specialize in digital services such as design and strategy, production and social media content. </p>

            <p>“I like what the effect you have gone for by trying to turn the ‘o’ into a grape, but to me it resembles an olive and I am not a fan of the font. I really like the font used in the bottom row, middle options as it is bold and fits nicely with the style vision seen in the mood boards.”</p>

            <h1>Graphic elements</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>Next, I decided to start to think about what graphic elements and icons I could create for Glou Glou, to use in many different ways such as a pattern or on menus. Graphic elements are more than just decorative—they are strategic tools that help communicate a brand’s story, connect with customers, and create a memorable experience. In a wine bar, where atmosphere and experience are key, these visuals play a crucial role in shaping how people perceive and interact with your brand.</p>
            <p>I started this process on pen and paper, drawing little doodles that came to mine when thinking of a wine bar. I decided to hand draw these as I wanted them to be casual and fun, to align with the core values I had previously determined. Next I took my scanned doodles into Adobe Illutsrator to edit them using the Image Trace feauture. I then played around with the sizing and positioning to create a pattern that could be repated. I also filled up white spaces with other elements I found on Pintrest.</p>
