        <div class="process-text">
            <p>To begin the design aspect of the project, I created a mood board containing inspirational images that I found on platforms such as Dribble and Pinterest, to clearly convey the ‘vibe’ I envisioned and set the creative direction. I also shared this mood board with Josh, whom I chose to guide me through the process, so that he could also get an understanding of what I was trying to create. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>Once I identified the brand’s core values, I began exploring what kind of color palette would best embody them. To me, these values evoke a colorful, organic aesthetic with a touch of green to reflect nature. I also wanted the palette to feel warm and inviting, creating a sense of comfort and approachability. So, I began to experiment with colours that I felt worked best together in order to create some variations.</p>

        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>I then began to look for font ideas that I could use for the logo. I felt that a bold, text-based logo with unique typography would best capture the vision I had in mind. Additionally, I planned to incorporate graphics that could be used as patterns or visual elements to enhance the overall aesthetic. Since this wine bar isn’t an actual client of mine, I didn’t have access to client input or feedback. However, I see this as a positive opportunity—it gives me complete creative freedom to shape this project and fully express my personal style as a designer.</p>

        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>After creating 8 options for the start of my wordmark design, I decided that I wanted some feedback on the designs that I had created. As it was the Christmas holiday period, I was unable to receive feedback from my coaches and so I showed them to my father who is considered as a professional in the industry as he has his own company that specialize in digital services such as design and strategy, production and social media content. </p>

        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>I decided that I wanted more font options so I found some more bold, unique fonts on websites such as Dirtyline Studio and Free Faces. I then put the brand name in these fonts and compared them to the original options I had created.</p>
            <p>Through this, I noticed that I really liked the font the font in the middle of the bottom row in the first iteration (the one that is refered to in the feedback) and thus this gave me further confirmation that this was the best font for me to use.</p>

            <p>After confirming my font, I began to experiment with small tweaks such as word layout and letter positioning. I also put the logo in the colours of the colour palette to bring the vision to life. As seen below, I reflected the 'O's to resemble an olive/grape. This could represent either as they are a wine bar (grapes) and they serve olives on the menu so either interpretation could work.</p>

            <h1>Graphic elements</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>Next, I decided to start to think about what graphic elements and icons I could create for Glou Glou, to use in many different ways such as a pattern or on menus. Graphic elements are more than just decorative—they are strategic tools that help communicate a brand’s story, connect with customers, and create a memorable experience. In a wine bar, where atmosphere and experience are key, these visuals play a crucial role in shaping how people perceive and interact with your brand.</p>
            <p>I started this process on pen and paper, drawing little doodles that came to mine when thinking of a wine bar and using images online as references. I decided to hand draw these as I wanted them to be casual and fun, to align with the core values I had previously determined. Next I took my scanned doodles into Adobe Illutsrator to edit them using the Image Trace feauture. I then played around with the sizing and positioning to create a pattern that could be repated. I also filled up white spaces with other elements I found on Pintrest.</p>

            <p>"Your branding is a mix of breaking with the current brand (eg font, original: handwritten, casual; yours: very clean, constructed) and following the same principles (hand drawn graphic elements). There is nothing wrong with mixing these two, but right now your font doesn’t really mix well with the style of your hand-drawn elements you went for."</p>

            <p>Josh gave me some very helpful feedback which brought a lot of new aspects to my attention. He mentioned that in his opinion the font that I selected for the logo did not really align with the core values of the brand and was quite constructed and clean. Although I can see how the font could apear this way, to me the sans serif style and rounded edges of the letters give me more of a groovy, funky, approachable look rather than clean. </p>
            <p>However, I wanted to further explore this and so I decided to conduct some user testing in order to get an understanding on wheather others who fit into the target audience agreed with this feedback, in order to make sure the logo was the perfect representation of the brand.</p>

            <p>The objective of this user test was to gather feedback from a users who fit the demographic in order to evaluate whether the new logo for the Glou Glou wine bar effectively conveys the desired brand identity, particularly focusing on the style of the font. The test aimed to determine whether the logo appears more "clean and constructed" (as stated by the teacher) or "groovy and playful", as intended.</p>

            <p>A group of 5 participants were selected to provide their opinions on the logo design. These individuals were chosen based on their familiarity with design concepts and relevence to demographic/target audience of Glou Glou.</p>

            <h4>Questions Asked</h4>
            <p>Each participant was presented with the logo and asked the following questions:</p>
            <p>Q1) How would you describe the style of the font? (e.g., clean, groovy, playful, constructed, formal, casual)</p>
            <p>Q2): Do you think the logo reflects a playful and approachable wine bar atmosphere, or does it feel too structured and formal?</p>
            <p>Q3) Would you say that the logo balances well with hand-drawn graphic elements, or do you think the font style clashes with that approach?</p>
            <p>Q4) What overall vibe does the logo give you (e.g., retro, modern, minimalist, vibrant)?</p>

            <p>Q3) Yes: 3/5 participants said the font complements the hand-drawn elements and fits well with the overall groovy, retro aesthetic.
                No: 2/5 participants felt that the font could be slightly more casual to better match hand-drawn elements.</p>
            <p>Q4) Retro/Groovy: 5/5 participants
                Modern: 2/5 participants

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="aside-text">
            <p>The user test results showed that the majority of participants perceive the logo's font as groovy, playful, and retro, aligning with the intended style. While a few participants noted that the font has a clean and structured feel, this was generally seen as complementary to its overall retro vibe and was not going against the core values. Most participants agreed that the logo effectively conveys a playful and approachable atmosphere, making it suitable for a casual wine bar like Glou Glou.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the balance between the font and hand-drawn graphic elements was well-received, with only minor suggestions for improvement, such as making all of the elements simple drawings rather than some of them hvaing more detail that others. Overall, the feedback supports the idea that the logo successfully reflects the intended brand identity.</p>

            <p>With this feedback from my teacher and the user test, I decided to create a brand guide to bring the logo and other branding elements to life, to make sure that evrything looked cohesive and fit nicely togther. I created this brand guide on Figma and used other company brand guides that I found online as a reference, in order to ensure that I covered all key elements.</p>
