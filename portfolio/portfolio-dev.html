                <p>After creating my full Figma design, I began to bring my portoflio to life and begin coding. I started by setting up my Git repository, in order to track my changes but also for hosting. I  chose to host my website on Github instead of using Hera as I have previosuly had major issues with Hera where I could not commit my chnages unless I was conected to the school wifi network, which created some problems for me.</p>
