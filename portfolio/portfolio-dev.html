                <p>After creating my full Figma design, I began to bring my portoflio to life and begin coding. I started by setting up my Git repository, in order to track my changes but also for hosting. I  chose to host my website on Github instead of using Hera as I have previosuly had major issues with Hera where I could not commit my changes unless I was conected to the school wifi network, which created some problems for me. So, this is way of hosting has worked well for me previously and so I have continued to use it. </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, my dedication and consistent effort on my portfolio are clearly reflected in the frequent commit messages on Git. These commits highlight my steady progress and show that I approached the project with discipline and regular updates rather than leaving it until the last minute and rushing. This methodical approach ensured a higher quality outcome and allowed me to refine and improve the portfolio over time.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Designing my layout using a grid-based approach was a game-changer for positioning elements perfectly on the page. I utilized grid containers for each section of my website, and this method not only streamlined the development process but also ensured a clean, organized structure. As this was my first experience building a website with grids, I found it to be an incredibly efficient way of coding.</p>
                <p>One of the standout advantages of this approach was the reusability of the sections I built. Since the layout remained consistent, I could easily repurpose these sections across different projects. This significantly reduced the time and effort required later in the development process. Overall, adopting grids improved both my workflow and the scalability of my designs, and it’s a technique I’ll undoubtedly continue to use in future projects.</p>

                <h1>Side Bar Navigation</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Initially, my portfolio design focused heavily on maintaining a clean and minimal aesthetic, and I hadn’t given much thought to the navigation aspect. I was determined to avoid cluttering the screen with a navigation bar. However, as I started incorporating all of my projects, I realized that navigating the portfolio became difficult for users by scrolling through the portfolio myself.</p>
                <p>To address this, I decided to implement a minimal sidebar that seamlessly matched the overall design. This sidebar not only preserved the simplicity of the layout but also provided a convenient way for users to navigate between projects. Additionally, I included a smooth transition effect that hides the sidebar on the hero page, ensuring that the main introduction remains distraction-free.  </p>

                <p>After implementing the sidebar, I conducted a user testing session to evaluate its functionality and ensure smooth navigation throughout the portfolio. The test was designed to simulate real-world interactions and identify any areas for improvement.</p>

                <h4>Testing Setup and Tasks</h4>
                <p>I invited a user to complete the following tasks:</p>
                <p> 1. Navigate from the Hero Page to Project 2
                    <br>2. Open the Design Process Section in Project 2
                    <br>3. Navigate from the Design Process Section in Project 2 to the Portfolio Creation Section
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Results and Feedback</h4>
                <p>The overall feedback was positive. The user reported that the navigation felt intuitive and seamless, and the sidebar's minimal design complemented the portfolio's clean aesthetic. However, one area of improvement was identified: when viewing the design process or research sections of a project which open onto a new page, it wasn’t immediately clear which project the user was exploring.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>suggestions</h4>
                <p>The user suggested highlighting the active project number in the sidebar while on seperate pages such as the design or research sections. This small but impactful adjustment would improve clarity and provide users with a stronger sense of orientation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Improvements Implemented</h4>
                <p>Based on the feedback, I updated the sidebar to highlight the current project number whenever a user navigates to a subsection like the design or research pages. This enhancement ensures users always know where they are within the portfolio, enhancing both usability and the overall user experience.</p>
                <p>By conducting this test, I was able to refine the navigation system and ensure it met the needs of potential users, aligning with my goal of creating a functional and user-friendly portfolio.</p>

                <p>For my hero page, I wanted something that was eye catching and visually different to the rest of my portfolio, but still looked sleek. I decided to create a moving gradient affect with big blobs floating in the backfound. I followed a youtube tutorial by WeCoded and tweaked it to fit my aesthetic and needs. </p>

                <p>1) <span class="highlight">.gradient-bg:</span> This is the main container for the background effect.</p>
                <p>2) SVG Filter <span class="highlight">(goo)</span> Defines a "gooey effect" using a combination of:</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">feGaussianBlur</span>: Applies a blur to the elements.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">feColorMatrix</span>: Modifies the color intensity and creates a "gooey" appearance by adjusting alpha values.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">feBlend</span>: Blends the blurred elements with the original content.</p>
                <p>3) <span class="highlight">.gradients-container</span>: Contains multiple gradient circles (<span class="highlight">.g1</span> to <span class="highlight">.g5</span>) that will animate to create a fluid and dynamic background effect.

            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>CSS Styling</h4>
                <p>1) The container applies the gooey filter (<span class="highlight">url(#goo)</span>) and an additional <span class="highlight">blur(40px)</span> for a smoother look. It spans the full width and height of the parent element.</p>
                <p>2) The SVG is hidden since it’s only used to define the filter.</p>
                <p>3) Each (<span class="highlight">.g1</span> to <span class="highlight">.g5</span>) represents a circular gradient blob with unique animations.</p>
                <p>POSITIONING: The circles are centered using <span class="highlight">calc(50% - var(--circle-size) / 2)</span>.</p>
                <p>RADIAL GRADIENTS: The <span class="highlight">mix-blend-mode</span> property ensures that the gradients blend creatively with each other and the background, creating unique visual effects.</p>
                <p>OPACITY: Each circle has an opacity value to enhance blending and make the effect smoother.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>1) <span class="highlight">moveVertical</span>: Animates the gradient blobs vertically.</p>
                <p>2) <span class="highlight">moveInCircle</span>: Rotates the blobs in a circular path.</p>
                <p>3) <span class="highlight">moveHorizontal</span>: Animates the blobs horizontally.</p>
                <p>4) The different durations (20s, 30s, etc.) and easing (ease, linear, etc.) create a fluid, asynchronous motion for the blobs, making the background feel dynamic.</p>
