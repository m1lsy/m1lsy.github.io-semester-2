            </div>
            <div class="process-text">
                <p>To start the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM’s music, which is an experimental, improvised electronic band. While doing this, we created mood boards to visually interpret how we each connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the emotions and energy it evoked. These mood boards helped us gain a deeper understanding of the band's avant-garde identity, which became a major source of inspiration for our design work. From there, I took some of the images from the mood boards and used them to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with various design elements to capture the experimental vibe of Nasmak PM's music and express their unique style.

                <h1>CREATING POSTERS</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The first poster was inspired by the music video for "Middle of the Road," incorporating images from the video itself. I was particularly influenced by the layered visuals and the dynamic, layered sounds in the song, so I applied a similar technique by layering images and textures to create that same depth and complexity. The second poster took on a completely different vibe and was inspired by one of the posters in my mood board. I experimented with a fisheye effect using one of their images, which I think turned out really striking. To enhance the grunge aesthetic, I layered a grainy texture on top.</p>
                <p>After completing these posters, I shared them with the client for feedback and also conducted user testing to collect feedback from individuals with diverse demographics and music preferences. The testing provided valuable insights into the design's strengths and areas for improvement.</p>

                <p>The bold graphic style, especially the fisheye effect in Poster 2, was frequently highlighted as eye-catching and memorable.
                    Texture effects in Poster 1 were appreciated, though there was a recurring suggestion to incorporate more vibrant colours to enhance visual impact.</p>

                <h4>2. Clarity and Content:</h4>
            <p>Poster 1 was noted for its clear presentation of event details, making it more functional for its purpose.
                Suggestions included adding QR codes, social media handles, or album names to provide easier access to additional information.</p>

                <h4>3. Alignment with Band Identity:</h4>
                <p>Both posters effectively conveyed the band's bold and unique aesthetic. However, enhancing interactivity with            call-to-actions such as “Follow us” or including event-specific details could strengthen engagement.</p>

                <p>"Both posters effectively represent the band's aesthetic. The fisheye effect in Poster 2 is eye-catching, and I like that Poster 1 has similarities to our music video. Overall, the designs are very impressive! I would like to see more digital posters for social media use, for us to advertise upcoming tour dates.”</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To meet the client's request for posters better suited to digital formats, I created a square tour poster optimized for Instagram. I drew inspiration from an existing image of the band, incorporating a unique 'tin-can' concept as a creative and experimental way to showcase the band members, instead of opting for a traditional group photo. For the text, I chose bright red and yellow, which provide a striking contrast against the black-and-white image.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I developed a second version of the poster featuring the two mascots my team and I designed for the band. The idea is to make these mascots a recurring element across all of the band's posters and social media content, establishing them as a recognizable brand identity.</p>
