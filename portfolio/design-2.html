            <div class="process-text">
                <p>To kick off the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM's music—a unique, improvised experimental electronic band—while creating mood boards. This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style.

                <h1>CREATING POSTERS</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The first poster was inspired by the music video for "Middle of the Road," incorporating images from the video itself. I was particularly influenced by the layered visuals and the dynamic, layered sounds in the song, so I applied a similar technique by layering images and textures to create that same depth and complexity. The second poster took on a completely different vibe and was inspired by one of the posters in my mood board. I experimented with a fisheye effect using one of their images, which I think turned out really striking. To enhance the grunge aesthetic, I layered a grainy texture on top.</p>
                <p>After completing these posters, I shared them with the client for feedback and also conducted user testing to collect feedback from individuals with diverse demographics and music preferences. The testing provided valuable insights into the design's strengths and areas for improvement.</p>

                <h4>1. Visual Appeal and Design Elements:</h4>
                <p>The bold graphic style, especially the fisheye effect in Poster 2, was frequently highlighted as eye-catching and memorable.
                    Texture effects in Poster 1 were appreciated, though there was a recurring suggestion to incorporate more vibrant colours to enhance visual impact.</p>

                <h4>2. Clarity and Content:</h4>
            <p>Poster 1 was noted for its clear presentation of event details, making it more functional for its purpose.
                Suggestions included adding QR codes, social media handles, or album names to provide easier access to additional information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-item">
                <h4>3. Alignment with Band Identity:</h4>
                <p>Both posters effectively conveyed the band's bold and unique aesthetic. However, enhancing interactivity with            call-to-actions such as “Follow us” or including event-specific details could strengthen engagement.</p>
