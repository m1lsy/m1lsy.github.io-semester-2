                <p>To kick off the design process, I suggested that my teammates and I listen to Nasmak PM's music—a unique, improvised experimental electronic band—while creating mood boards. This approach allowed us to visually interpret how each of us connected with their distinctive sound, capturing the diverse emotional responses and energy we felt. These mood boards not only provided valuable insights into the band's avant-garde identity but also served as a key source of inspiration for our design work moving forward. Building on this, I used some of the images from the mood boards to create posters in Photoshop, experimenting with different design elements to capture the experimental essence of Nasmak PM's music and visually represent their unique style.
