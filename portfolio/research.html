                <p>To begin the rebranding process, I started by making use of the Field Research Method and interviewing people who fit into the target audience. This consisted of students from various studies who had recently completed or were in the process of choosing their minor study.

                <h4>1. Search Process & Selection Factors:</h4>
                <p>
                    The students used the website Keesopminor.nl to explore various minors within the Netherlands. A primary factor for one of the students was finding a minor that emphasized creativity. They also utilized social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube to gain insights into the student experience for each minor, particularly valuing "day in the life" content that showcased student projects and activities

                <h4>4. First Impressions of the Minor:</h4>
                <p>
                    The Health Innovation Minor, which combines technology and healthcare, appeared highly innovative and unique, allowing for collaboration with students from different fields. However, it was noted that this minor would primarily appeal to those interested in the healthcare industry, which didn’t align with the specific interests of one of the students.

                <h4>3. Description of the Minor for Peers:</h4>
                <p>
                    The minor was described as a healthcare-focused program with an emphasis on technology, design, and business development, aimed at generating new ideas to tackle medical challenges.

                <h4>4. Clarity of the Minor's Webpage:</h4>
                <p>
                    Both students felt that the website provided a thorough explanation of the minor’s scope and objectives, albeit with extensive text. They suggested that additional visuals would help clarify what the program entails, especially for creative-minded students.

                <h4>5. Branding Feedback:</h4>
                <p>
                    The students had mixed opinions about the minor's branding. While one found the logo to effectively represent healthcare and innovation (using a cross symbol and circuit lines), another felt the logo and colors were too generic and could benefit from a more unique approach.

                <p>After conducting the interviews and analysing the results, I started defining the core values of the brand in order to help focus the design direction. Once the core values were defined, we made a few colour palette options which we felt reflected these values. We created a survey and people who fit within the demographic of our target audience to select which adjectives they felt best described the colours.</p>
