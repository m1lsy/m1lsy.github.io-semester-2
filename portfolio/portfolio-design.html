            <div class="process-text">
                <p>I started my portfolio creation process by looking on websites such as Dribble and Awwards for inspiration. I made a few wireframes in Figma to play around with different layouts and ideas that came from these websites in order to see what would work best for me. </p>

                <h1>First Iteration</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>I then created my first design iteration by combining elements from websites that inspired me with some of my own ideas. Reflecting on my previous portfolios, I realized that I often included too much text in an attempt to convey my points. To address this, I focused on developing a layout that organizes my content clearly and concisely, making it easier for assessors to navigate and understand. This approach eliminates the need for assessors to sift through lengthy paragraphs, allowing them to quickly grasp the key information.</p>

                <p>The design below is heavoly inspired by <a href="https://rubicom.ch/en/" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Rubicom</span></a>, a website I discovered through Awwwards. I was drawn to this website as their main colour used is one that I really like and that I use in a lot of my designs, including my previous portfolio. This colour is reacurring in my life as it represents some of my favourite albums including 'Syro' by Aphex Twin and 'Brat' by Charli XCX. One of my goals as a designer is to have a colour associated with me to create a visual ideneity and so I wanted this colour to be consistent and play a role in this portoflio too. I was also drawn to the simplistic, clean layout of this webiste and so I decided to replicate it. After creating my designs, I also asked Jo-An for feedback. </p>

                <p>Taking the feedback from Jo-An, I created my next iteration which combined some aspects from my first iteration, such has graphic elements and colours, and a new layout inspired by the portfolio of <a href="https://www.alejandromejias.com.au/#hero" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Alejandro Mejias</span></a>. I also discovered this designer on Awwards and I really liked the way he displayed his different projects. Once I had created this iteration, I showed Frank and Stan to get some feedback. </p>

                <h1>Third Iteration</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The feedback I received from both Frank and Stan was positive and gave me reassurance that I was on the right track. Although both were happy with the current layout that I chose, Stan showed me some more websites with different layouts to provide me with more inspiration. </p>

                <p>One of those websites was '<a href="https://unseen.co/" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">unseen.co</span></a>' which really spoke to me. What I liked about this particular website was that it displayed project pages in a new way that I had not thought of before. Instead of making the webpage look like a Microsoft Word Document with text boxes and images, the layout of the website felt more like a presentation that was really showcasing all of the work instead. Stan also showed me how to correctly create designs in Figma by using grids to ensure a perfect layout, which I was not using previously. </p>
                <p>Using this new inspiration and new design tools provided to me, I created my third design iteration and produced an interactive prototype on Figma.</p>
